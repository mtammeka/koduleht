				The Dyatlov Pass incident
			</h1>
			
			<p>
				The Dyatlov Pass incident (Russian: <em>Гибель тургруппы Дятлова</em>) refers to
				the mysterious unsolved deaths of nine ski hikers in the northern Ural Mountains
				on February 2, 1959. The experienced trekking group, who were all from the Ural
				Polytechnical Institute, had established a camp on the slopes of Kholat Syakhl
				when disaster struck. During the night something made them tear their way out of
				their tents from the inside and flee the campsite inadequately dressed in heavy
				snowfall and sub-zero temperatures.
			</p>
			<p>
				Soviet investigators determined that six victims died from hypothermia while
				others showed signs of physical trauma. One victim had a fractured skull while
				another had brain damage but without any sign of distress to their skull.
				<strong>Additionally, a female team member had her tongue missing.</strong>
				The investigation concluded that an "unknown compelling force" had caused the
				deaths. Access to the region was consequently closed to amateur hikers and
				expeditions for three years after the incident (the area is named Dyatlov Pass
				in honor of the group's leader, Igor Dyatlov).
			</p>
			<p>
				As the chronology of events remains uncertain due to the lack of survivors,
				several explanations have been put forward as to the cause; they include an
				animal attack, hypothermia, an avalanche, infrasound-induced panic, military
				involvement, or a combination of explanations.

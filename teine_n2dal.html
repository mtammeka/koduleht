				The Dyatlov Pass incident
			</h1>
			
			<p>
				The Dyatlov Pass incident (Russian: <em>Гибель тургруппы Дятлова</em>) refers to
				the mysterious unsolved deaths of nine ski hikers in the northern Ural Mountains
				on February 2, 1959. The experienced trekking group, who were all from the Ural
				Polytechnical Institute, had established a camp on the slopes of Kholat Syakhl
				when disaster struck. During the night something made them tear their way out of
				their tents from the inside and flee the campsite inadequately dressed in heavy
				snowfall and sub-zero temperatures.
